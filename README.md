# Micro Frontend Application

Microfrontend is an architectural approach that involves breaking down a web application into smaller, independently deployable and scalable parts. Each part, or microfrontend, is responsible for rendering a specific part of the user interface.

# Benefits of microfrontend

Improved scalability: Microfrontends allow for the application to be split into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to scale individual features and components as needed.

Faster development cycles: Teams can work on different microfrontends simultaneously, allowing for faster development cycles and the ability to update specific features without affecting the entire application.

Better team productivity: With microfrontends, each team can focus on a specific area of the application, allowing for more specialized expertise and faster development.

Simpler codebase management: With a microfrontend architecture, it's easier to manage and maintain the codebase. Since each microfrontend is a separate application, they can be developed and tested independently, reducing the risk of issues or conflicts between different parts of the code.

Improved user experience: Microfrontend architecture can improve user experience by enabling the creation of more lightweight, faster-loading pages. Each microfrontend can load independently, allowing users to interact with the application while other parts of the application are still loading.

Flexibility: Microfrontends can be developed using different technologies, making it easier to adopt new frameworks and tools or to migrate to new technology stacks without affecting the entire application.
